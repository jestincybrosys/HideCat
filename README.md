The plugin allows you to filter products based on their stock status, which includes whether a product is "in stock" or "out of stock.
" This helps you ensure that customers only see products that are available for purchase, improving their shopping experience.

== Description ==
The plugin integrates seamlessly with WooCommerce's product categories. It provides options to manage product visibility on a 
per-category basis, allowing you to control which categories display out-of-stock products and which categories do not. WooCommerce 
currently lets you either hide all out of stock products or none. This expands on that and lets you choose a category to hide when out of stock.

You might want to use this to keep newer products on your website eventhough they're out of stock. Hiding the older, out of stock WooCommerce 
products would remove some clutter.

== Installation ==
